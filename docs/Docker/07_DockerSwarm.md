#### What is Docker Swarm?
* Docker swarm is a container orchestration tool, meaning that it allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple host machines.
  
* A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that have been configured to join together in a cluster.
  
* The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.

#### Benefits
* Availability and scaling
* Easy installation and setup
* Auto Load Balancing
* Rollback faatures
* Scaling
  
#### Initialize Docker Swarm
Run below command in master node. It will generate token for add worker node into manager node. We need to copy this token and run in worker nodes.
```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <host ip>
```

**Note:** If you want to add another manager (For availability), You need to run below comamnd. Below command will generate token for add new manager node into our primary node.

```
docker swarm join-token manager
```
#### How to Join worker node into Manager node
Get the token from manager node and run that "docker swarm join --token" command in worker nodes
```
docker swarm join --token <token values and ip> 
```

#### List all docker swarm nodes
```
docker node ls
```

**Note**
Swarm related commands only execute in manger node. If we execute in worker node, you will get below error

#### Docker service command Options
```
docker service --help
```

#### How to run image into container using docker service
```
docker service create --replicas <int> -p <manager host port>: <container port> --name <service name> <image name>
docker service create --replicas 5 -p 9001:80 --name mywebappservice httpd
```

#### List docker services
```
docker service ls
```

#### How to find the nodes which my containers are running
```
docker service ps <service name>
```

#### Usage of Global mode instead of Replicas
There is two types of mode in docker service.

**One is replicas** - User can define how many replicas need to create. Docker swarm will allocate the nodes to run the containers based on load, usage, etc... (For Example: If we set 5 replicas, 3 containers will run on node1 and 2 containers will run on node2 or manager node or vice versa)

**Other one is Global** - If we set mode as global, container will run each node which we have created. (For Example: If we have three docker nodes, docker service will run container on each node which means it will run node1, node2 & manger node) 

```
docker service --mode global -p <port forwarding> --name <service name> <Image>
```

#### Docker swarm network
In default, Docker swarm will use Overlay driver (Ingress network). It enable the commuication between across the docker hosts.

#### Docker Scale up and down
```
docker service scale <service name>=<int>

Let us consider, Currently two replicas is running. If we want to scale up to 5 replicas, run below commad.

docker service scale mywebapp=5

Let us consider, Currently five replicas is running. If we want to scale down to 2 replicas, run below commad.

docker service scale mywebapp=2
```

This scale up command additionally will create replicas and existing will be running without any effect (Refer below screenshot. Check Container launch time)
